# React Todo List

My first React.js app ... Created using Creat React App and this tutorial:

## replication

-   download the repository
-   "npm install" to install dependencies
-   "npm start" to run the local server
-   "npm run build" to create a production build in the folder "/build" -> deploy that anywhere
